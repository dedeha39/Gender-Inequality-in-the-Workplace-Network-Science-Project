## Abstract

Gender inequality in the workplace persists despite efforts towards progress. This document outlines the necessity of addressing gender disparities, not only ethically but also for organizational success and innovation. Various aspects of workplace gender inequality such as unequal pay, glass ceilings, discrimination, and societal expectations are highlighted.

## Motivation

The project aims to comprehensively explore gender inequality in the workplace, covering issues such as unequal pay, glass ceilings, gender bias, and stereotypes. The focus extends to examining occupational segregation, industry-specific gender gaps, workplace discrimination, harassment, and societal expectations. Additionally, corporate culture and policies' role in perpetuating or mitigating gender-based challenges will be investigated. Insights from Reddit posts and comments will provide valuable perspectives on lived experiences related to workplace gender inequality.

## Data Collection & Processing

Efforts are directed towards collecting and processing Reddit posts and comments related to women and gender inequality. Subtopics identified include discussions on the gender pay gap, workplace discrimination, glass ceiling, sexual harassment, diversity and inclusion, career advancement challenges, stereotypes and biases, maternity and family leave, intersectionality, and empowerment initiatives. The data collection process involves basic and advanced cleaning operations, hashtag extraction, and subsequent analysis.

## Building Semantic Network

The creation of a semantic network involves extracting key themes from Reddit posts and comments to establish meaningful connections. Natural language processing techniques are employed to identify topics as nodes and relationships as edges in the network. Community detection algorithms such as Soft Louvain, Hard Louvain, and BERTopic are utilized to reveal underlying community structures within the network.

## Obtained Results

The project assesses and compares community detection methodologies, visualizing community structures and document allocations within each community. WordCloud visualization is employed to illustrate the communities identified by the Louvain algorithm, emphasizing word frequencies and enhancing aesthetic appeal.
